# JQuery-Pet-My-Pet
### JS Apps Exam Project for sharing pets profiles

The project is a Single Page Web Application using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, REST and JSON with cloud-based backend (Kinvey). It also relies on jQuery, Handlebars and Sammy libraries
The app supports validation for the fields of all forms and shows notification messages for success, error or loading.

The app keeps **users** and **pets**. Users can register, login, logout and view a dashboard with all pets *sorted by likes*. They can also view the pets by category, view pet details, like other people's pets, add a new pet, visit a section where they can view their own pets and edit and/or delete each of them.

The user can see the following **views**: 

Home Page with Navbar that changes according to the user's status - logged in or not.

Register Page - for new users

Login Page - for users with registration

Dashboard with all pets, not created by the current user. Each pet has a ''pet'('like') button and a counter that is updated after each click of the button. The order of the pets is also updated if needed. 

Filter by category - the pets can be filtered by six categories and again are ordered by their 'pet' counter.

Details Page - shows detailed info about the selected pet, a 'pet' button and updating counter.

Add pet Page - a logged in user can add as many pets as he/she likes by filling the form

My pets Page - shows all pets added by the current user with details and edit and delete options.

Edit Page - a user can edit his/her pet's description at any time

Delete page - shows info for the pet in disabled fields and a delete button
